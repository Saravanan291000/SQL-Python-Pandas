# SQL-Python-Pandas

This is the data sets which I took from Kaggles to make some data analysis, Here I make my own questions to business requirements.
This data sets contains coffee sales for an particular shop for 6 months.
# Business Requirement
 1. What is the sales for each month
 2. What is the slaes by cash type for every month
 3. Which coffee is sold at higher rate
 4. How many coffee sold in 6 months

This are some basic analysis , if you have some idea to create new requirements then you're so good.
